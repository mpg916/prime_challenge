prime_challenge
===============

#Use of Application#

./prime_challenge.sh (argument | optional)

Argument - Can be any integer to return N primes. If argument is not present, it defaults to 10.

#Coding challenge#

Objective
---------

Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime
numbers.

The program must run from the command line and print one table to
STDOUT.

The first row and column of the table should have the 10 primes, with
each cell containing the product of the primes for the corresponding row and
column.

Notes
-----

* Consider complexity. How fast does your code run? How does it scale?
* Consider cases where we want more than N primes.
* Do not use the Prime class from stdlib (write your own code).
* Write tests. Demonstrate TDD/BDD.
